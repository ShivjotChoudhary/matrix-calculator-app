# 🧮 Matrix Calculator Desktop App (NumPy)

> 🚀 **From a simple NumPy project to a real macOS desktop application — without traditional app development**

This project demonstrates how a **basic NumPy-based matrix calculator** can be transformed into a **fully runnable desktop application** using Python tools only.

It is amazing that we can build **real desktop apps** without learning native app development frameworks like **Swift, Java, or Kotlin**.

## ✨ Project Overview

Originally, this was a **command-line NumPy project** that performed matrix operations.  
Later, it was converted into a **GUI-based desktop application** and finally packaged as a **macOS `.app` file**.

This shows the real power of Python beyond scripts.

## 🔧 Features

- ➕ Matrix Addition  
- ✖️ Matrix Multiplication  
- 🔁 Transpose of a Matrix  
- 🧮 Determinant Calculation  
- 🔄 Inverse of a Matrix  
- 🖥️ Clean and simple GUI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NumPy** – matrix operations
- **Tkinter** – graphical user interface
- **PyInstaller** – packaging Python app into a macOS `.app`

## 🏗️ How This Project Was Built (Step by Step)

1. **Matrix Logic using NumPy**  
   - Implemented matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, transpose, determinant, and inverse using NumPy.

2. **GUI Development (Tkinter)**  
   - Created input fields for matrices.
   - Added buttons for each operation.
   - Displayed results dynamically in the interface.

3. **Desktop App Packaging**  
   - Used **PyInstaller** to convert the Python GUI program into a native macOS `.app` file.
   - Added a custom application icon.
   - Generated a runnable desktop application.

4. **Distribution using GitHub Releases**  
   - Source code is kept in the repository.
   - The runnable macOS app is provided separately via **GitHub Releases**.

## 📦 Download & Run

👉 Go to the **Releases** section of this repository and download:

Unzip it to get `Matrix Calculator.app`.

## 🔐 macOS Security Notice (Important)

⚠️ This application is a **student project** and is **not signed with an Apple Developer ID**.

Because of this, macOS may block the app on first launch.  
This is **normal and expected behavior**.

### ✅ How to open the app on macOS (Working Method)

1. Download the app from **Releases**
2. Unzip the file
3. Try opening the app once (it will be blocked)
4. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
5. Scroll down and click **Open Anyway**
6. Confirm **Open**

✔️ After this, the app will open normally every time.

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

- Learned how **NumPy logic** can be used in real applications  
- Understood how Python GUI apps are built using **Tkinter**  
- Learned how to package Python programs into **desktop applications**  
- Realized that **traditional app development is not always required** to build apps
