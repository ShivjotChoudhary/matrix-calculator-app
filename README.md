# 🧮 Matrix Calculator Desktop App (NumPy)

> 🚀 **From a simple NumPy project to a real macOS desktop application — without traditional app development**

This project demonstrates how a **basic NumPy-based matrix calculator** can be transformed into a **fully runnable desktop application** using Python tools only.

It is amazing that we can build **real desktop apps** without learning native app development frameworks like **Swift, Java, or Kotlin**.

## ✨ Project Overview

Originally, this was a **command-line NumPy project** that performed matrix operations.  
Later, it was converted into a **GUI-based desktop application** and finally packaged as a **macOS `.app` file**.

This shows the real power of Python beyond scripts.

## 🏗️ How This Project Was Built (Step by Step)

1. **Matrix Logic using NumPy**  
   - Implemented matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, transpose, determinant, and inverse using NumPy.

2. **GUI Development (Tkinter)**  
   - Created input fields for matrices.
   - Added buttons for each operation.
   - Displayed results dynamically in the interface.

3. **Desktop App Packaging**  
   - Used **PyInstaller** to convert the Python GUI program into a native macOS `.app` file.
   - Added a custom application icon.
   - Generated a runnable desktop application.

4. **Distribution using GitHub Releases**  
   - Source code is kept in the repository.
   - The runnable macOS app is provided separately via **GitHub Releases**.
